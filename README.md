# Bespoke Synth
A software modular synth that I'm building for myself, and you can use it if you want to. If you're interested, you can find some out of date documentation at https://www.reddit.com/r/BespokeSynth, or you can just jump in and start messing around.

You can find the most recent builds for Mac/Windows/Linux at https://github.com/awwbees/BespokeSynth/releases. To find the download, expand the "Assets" dropdown under the latest release.

**Heads up that a new release is imminent! You can get access to a prerelease build by joining the [Bespoke Discord](https://discord.gg/YdTMkvvpZZ)**

### Notes
Some context: this is my home project that I've been working on since 2011 and has grown and sprawled like weeds. It has served as a learning platform for me, which means that some of it was written by my mediocre 2011 self, some of it is written by my hopefully-less-mediocre today self, and other parts were written at various levels of my mediocrity in between. It has many modules, ~some of which I haven't touched in years, some of which are likely hugely broken.~ (Update: I have done a huge cleanup pass! All of those older modules function nicely now)
