run ./bespoke_dependencies.sh to install all dependencies needed to run (or compile!) Bespoke.

some opengl versions will complain when you start the app. running via ./Bespoke-GLSLfix.sh may fix this issue for you.

 very brief "getting started" guide:
 * hold the 'o' key and choose "oscillator"
 * drag the circle at the bottom of the oscillator to patch a cable onto the "gain" module
 * hold the 'n' key and choose "notesequencer"
 * drag the circle at the bottom of the notesequencer to patch a cable onto the "oscillator" module
 * tada!
