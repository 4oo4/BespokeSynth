install to /Applications/BespokeSynth/ to run

if OSX complains that it can't open because bespoke is from an "unidentified developer":
 1. open system preferences
 2. navigate to the security and privacy menu
 3. under the general tab, you'll see bespoke in the text at the bottom. next to it, select "open anyway"

 very brief "getting started" guide:
 * hold the 'o' key and choose "oscillator"
 * drag the circle at the bottom of the oscillator to patch a cable onto the "gain" module
 * hold the 'n' key and choose "notesequencer"
 * drag the circle at the bottom of the notesequencer to patch a cable onto the "oscillator" module
 * tada!
