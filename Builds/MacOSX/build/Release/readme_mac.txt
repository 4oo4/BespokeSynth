install to /Applications/BespokeSynth/ to run

if macOS complains that bespoke can't open because it can't verify the developer:
 1. right click bespoke
 2. select "open"
 3. in the resulting popup, click "open"

 very brief "getting started" guide:
 * hold the 'o' key and choose "oscillator"
 * drag the circle at the bottom of the oscillator to patch a cable onto the "gain" module
 * hold the 'n' key and choose "notesequencer"
 * drag the circle at the bottom of the notesequencer to patch a cable onto the "oscillator" module
 * tada!
